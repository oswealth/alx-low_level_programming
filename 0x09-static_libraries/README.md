#C - Static libraries
A library is a file containing several object files, that can be used as a single entity in a linking phase of a program.
Normally the library is indexed, so it is easy to find symbols (functions, variables and so on) in them.
For this reason, linking a program whose object files are ordered in libraries is faster than linking a program whose object files are separate on the disk.
