Solutions to Tasks on C - Singly linked lists.
A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.
 It does not have any pointer that points to the previous node. That means we can traverse the list only in forward direction.
Singly linked lists are often used because they require less memory than doubly linked lists, which have pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
