C - File I/O
File I/O in C is the process of reading and writing data to and from files using the C programming language.
Files are used to store information permanently on a storage device, such as a hard disk, a flash drive, or a CD-ROM.
There are two types of files that can be handled in C: text files and binary files. Text files store data as plain text, using ASCII or Unicode characters.
Binary files store data as sequences of bits (0s and 1s), which may represent numbers, characters, or other types of information.
