C - Bit manipulation
Bit manipulation is a technique that involves working with bits or binary numbers directly.
 It can be useful for low-level device control, error detection and correction, data compression, encryption, and optimization.
Bit manipulation uses bitwise operators such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHIFT, etc. 
For example, you can use bit manipulation to set, clear, toggle, or test a specific bit in a number.
